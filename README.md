# NoobCash Blockchain

## Description
NoobCash is a simple blockchain system, used to register transactions between nodes, while consensus is verified by Proof-Of-Work. Each node is independent from the others, so that the system is decentralized.

This project consists of a rest API and a CLI tool. The rest API is used by nodes to communicate with each other. The CLI tool is used to initialize the nodes, create transactions between these nodes, view transactions and print balance of nodes. Apart from that, object-oriented Python was used to describe the different components of the system, which can be found in the blockchain folder.


## Technologies used
To create this system the following technologies were used:
* Python Flask for the API
* Python Argparse for the CLI commands
